//menu-driven program that asks the user
//for the initial length of the array, and then stores those corresponding strings (also taken as
//input) into a dynamic array initialised with that length. Then, begin a loop of the menu that
//prompts the user to select one of five options:
//(a) Add a string to the end of the array,
//(b) Add a string to the beginning of the array,
//(c) Delete the element at index ‘x’ (taken as input) of the array,
//(d) Display the length of the array,
//(e) Display all the elements of the array in sequence.
//The addition and deletion of strings must result in resizing of the array. The user should have a
//sixth option that would enable them to close the menu-driven program
